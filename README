master branch is automatically deployed to https://dvorak.iterinc.com

To develop interactively using CIDER:

M-x cider-jack-in-cljs

Choose browser as the CLJS REPL

By default on startup you should get the CLJS place-holder index -- from your CLJS repl run:

(require 'dvorak.main)

which should then re-draw and allow for interactive development. Note that it
will NOT auto-reload on changes. After editing a function, be sure to
re-evaluate it, and then force a re-draw. The most common approach I've taken to
get it to re-draw are to call dvorak.core/mountit so it will re-draw.
